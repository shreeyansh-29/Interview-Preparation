<!-- Given an integer array nums, a reducer function fn, and an initial value init, return a reduced array.

A reduced array is created by applying the following operation: val = fn(init, nums[0]), val = fn(val, nums[1]), 
val = fn(val, nums[2]), ... until every element in the array has been processed. The final value of val is returned.

If the length of the array is 0, it should return init.
 -->

<script>
  var reduce = function (nums, fn, init) {
    let ans = init;
    for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
      ans = fn(ans, nums[i]);
    }
    return ans;
  };

  function sum (a,b){
    return a + b;
  }

  console.log(reduce([1,2,3,4], sum, 0));
